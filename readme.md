# Welcome to the Fluid Framework Angular Examples Repository!

This codebase includes examples of collaborative applications built with the Fluid Framework and Angular. For documentation about the Fluid Framework, go to https://FluidFramework.com. The Fluid Framework repository lives at https://github.com/Microsoft/FluidFramework.

Each example is a standalone application that defines a Fluid Container and loads it into a webpage. To get started, clone the repo, go into a
example folder that you want to run, and follow the instructions in the example's `readme.md` file.

If you're using VS Code and don't already have the [Angular Language service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) we recommend installing it.
